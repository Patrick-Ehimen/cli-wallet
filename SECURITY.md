# Security Considerations and Best Practices

This document outlines important security considerations when using the CLI Wallet application and provides best practices for cryptographic key management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This application is designed for educational purposes only.** It demonstrates cryptographic concepts and should not be used with real cryptocurrency or in production environments. The authors are not responsible for any loss of funds or security breaches.

## üîê Cryptographic Security

### Algorithms Used

The CLI Wallet uses industry-standard cryptographic algorithms:

- **Elliptic Curve**: secp256k1 (same curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum)
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 for message hashing and address generation
- **Signature Scheme**: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generator

### Key Properties

- **Private Keys**: 256-bit (32 bytes) random numbers
- **Public Keys**: Derived from private keys using elliptic curve point multiplication
- **Signatures**: ECDSA signatures providing authentication and non-repudiation
- **Addresses**: 160-bit (20 bytes) derived from SHA-256 hash of public key

## üîë Private Key Security

### Critical Security Rules

1. **Never Share Private Keys**: Anyone with your private key can sign messages on your behalf
2. **Generate Keys Securely**: Always use cryptographically secure random number generation
3. **Store Keys Safely**: Use encrypted storage for private keys
4. **Use Unique Keys**: Generate separate key pairs for different purposes
5. **Backup Securely**: Create encrypted backups of important private keys

### Private Key Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ Do:

- Generate keys on secure, offline systems when possible
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for high-value keys
- Encrypt private keys before storing them
- Use strong, unique passwords for key encryption
- Create secure backups in multiple locations
- Test key recovery procedures regularly
- Use multi-signature schemes for shared control

#### ‚ùå Don't:

- Store private keys in plain text
- Share private keys via email, chat, or other insecure channels
- Use predictable or weak random number sources
- Store keys on internet-connected systems unnecessarily
- Use the same private key for multiple purposes
- Screenshot or photograph private keys
- Store keys in cloud services without encryption

### Key Generation Security

The CLI Wallet uses Rust's `rand` crate with the following security properties:

```rust
// Secure random number generation
use rand::rngs::OsRng;
use secp256k1::{Secp256k1, SecretKey};

let secp = Secp256k1::new();
let mut rng = OsRng;
let private_key = SecretKey::new(&mut rng);
```

**Security Features:**

- Uses operating system's cryptographically secure random number generator
- Provides sufficient entropy for cryptographic security
- Resistant to prediction and bias attacks
- Automatically seeded from system entropy sources

## üìù Message Signing Security

### Signature Properties

ECDSA signatures provide:

- **Authentication**: Proves the message was signed by the private key holder
- **Non-repudiation**: Signer cannot deny having signed the message
- **Integrity**: Any modification to the message invalidates the signature
- **Uniqueness**: Each signature is unique (due to random nonce generation)

### Signing Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ Do:

- Hash messages before signing (automatically done by the application)
- Use deterministic nonces when possible (RFC 6979)
- Verify your own signatures after creating them
- Include timestamps or sequence numbers in signed messages
- Use message formats that prevent signature reuse attacks

#### ‚ùå Don't:

- Sign empty or meaningless messages
- Reuse signatures across different contexts
- Sign messages you haven't read and understood
- Use predictable message formats that could be exploited
- Sign messages that could be interpreted differently in different contexts

### Message Format Security

When signing messages, consider:

```bash
# Good: Specific, contextual message
cli-wallet sign --message "Transfer 10 BTC to Alice on 2024-01-15 at 14:30 UTC"

# Bad: Generic message that could be misused
cli-wallet sign --message "I agree"
```

## ‚úÖ Signature Verification Security

### Verification Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ Do:

- Always verify signatures before trusting signed messages
- Check that the public key belongs to the expected signer
- Verify the message content matches your expectations
- Use secure channels to obtain public keys
- Implement proper error handling for verification failures

#### ‚ùå Don't:

- Trust signatures without verification
- Assume a signature is valid just because it "looks right"
- Use public keys from untrusted sources
- Skip verification in automated systems
- Ignore verification errors or warnings

### Public Key Authentication

Public keys themselves need to be authenticated:

1. **Certificate Authorities**: Use PKI infrastructure when available
2. **Web of Trust**: Verify keys through trusted intermediaries
3. **Out-of-Band Verification**: Confirm keys through separate communication channels
4. **Key Fingerprints**: Use key fingerprints for manual verification
5. **Blockchain Records**: Use immutable ledgers for key publication

## üõ°Ô∏è Application Security

### Memory Security

The CLI Wallet implements several memory security practices:

- **No Persistent Storage**: Private keys are only held in memory during operation
- **Secure Cleanup**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
- **Stack Allocation**: Uses stack allocation for temporary cryptographic data
- **Rust Safety**: Benefits from Rust's memory safety guarantees

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated:

```rust
// Example: Private key validation
pub fn validate_private_key_hex(hex_str: &str) -> Result<SecretKey, WalletError> {
    // Length validation
    if hex_str.len() != 64 {
        return Err(WalletError::invalid_input("Invalid key length"));
    }

    // Hex format validation
    let bytes = hex::decode(hex_str)?;

    // Cryptographic validation
    SecretKey::from_slice(&bytes)
        .map_err(|e| WalletError::key_generation(format!("Invalid key: {}", e)))
}
```

### Error Handling Security

The application provides secure error handling:

- **No Information Leakage**: Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- **Consistent Timing**: Avoids timing attacks through consistent error handling
- **Clear Feedback**: Provides helpful error messages without security risks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fails securely when errors occur

## üåê Network Security

### Offline Operation

The CLI Wallet is designed for offline use:

- **No Network Connections**: Never transmits keys or signatures over networks
- **Air-Gapped Operation**: Can be used on systems without network access
- **Local Processing**: All cryptographic operations happen locally
- **No Telemetry**: Doesn't collect or transmit usage data

### Secure Key Exchange

When sharing public keys or signatures:

#### ‚úÖ Secure Methods:

- Encrypted email with verified recipients
- Secure messaging apps with end-to-end encryption
- In-person exchange of key fingerprints
- Secure file sharing with access controls
- QR codes for short-distance sharing

#### ‚ùå Insecure Methods:

- Unencrypted email or messaging
- Public forums or social media
- Unsecured file sharing services
- SMS or phone calls
- Unverified communication channels

## üîç Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

The CLI Wallet protects against:

- **Key Prediction**: Uses cryptographically secure random generation
- **Signature Forgery**: ECDSA signatures cannot be forged without the private key
- **Message Tampering**: Signatures become invalid if messages are modified
- **Replay Attacks**: Each signature is unique and message-specific
- **Implementation Attacks**: Uses well-tested cryptographic libraries

### Threats NOT Mitigated

The CLI Wallet does NOT protect against:

- **Malware**: Malicious software could steal keys from memory
- **Physical Access**: Attackers with physical access could extract keys
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing or power analysis attacks
- **Social Engineering**: Tricking users into revealing keys
- **Quantum Computers**: Future quantum computers could break ECDSA
- **Implementation Bugs**: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Risk Assessment
